function [result] = analyze_expected_overlap(experiment, trackers, sequences, varargin)
% analyze_expected_overlap Performs expected average overlap analysis
%
% Performs expected average overlap analysis for a given experiment on a set trackers and sequences.
%
% Input:
% - experiment (structure): A valid experiment structure.
% - trackers (cell): A cell array of valid tracker descriptor structures.
% - sequences (cell): A cell array of valid sequence descriptor structures.
% - varargin[Tags] (cell): An array of tag names to be considered.
% - varargin[Lengths] (vector): Lengths for which to evaluated expected overlap.
% - varargin[Aggregation] (string): Aggregation method, either pooled or mean
% - varargin[Cache] (string): Cache directory.
%
% Output:
% - result (structure): A structure with the following fields
%     - curves: expected overlap curves
%     - practical: corresponding practical differences
%     - lengths: lengths for which the expected overlap was evaluated
