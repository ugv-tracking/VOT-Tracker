Welcome to TraX library documentation
=====================================

Welcome to TraX reference library documentation. TraX stands for visual Tracking eXchange, the protocol was designed to make development and testing of visual tracking algorithms simpler and faster. This documentation describes the protocol specification but also documents the reference library that implements the protocol and can be used to add support to visual tracking programs quickly and without the need to understand the low-level details.

The source code for the reference library is availabe on `GitHub <https://github.com/votchallenge/trax/>`_ under `Lesser GPL v3.0 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html>`_ license.
